Pop Quiz:
If you are in the Downloads folder, what folder is:

../  – mehtad
../../ – Users
../../mehtad/ –mehtad
../../mehtad/./ – mehtad
../../mehtad/./Downloads/../Documents – Documents

Take some time to cd around and explore your filesystem. See what is at the root, see if you can find some of the files you use daily.
Navigate to ~/Desktop and run both ls -a and tree
cd
cd Desktop/
ls -a
tree

Navigate to ~/Downloads and run the ls -l command to see information about every item in that folder
cd
cd Downloads/
ls -l

hint! - are you lost? don't know what to type next?

first type pwd to see "where you are"
then type ls to see what files and folders are there
then think about your next move, it might be cd <path>, where is either an absolute or relative filepath for where you want to navigate to.
